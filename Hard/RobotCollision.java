Example 1:
        Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = "RRRRR"
        Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
        Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

        Example 2:
        Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = "RLRL"
        Output: [14]
        Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

        Example 3:
        Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = "RLRL"
        Output: []
        Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].

        Constraints:
        1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105
        1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 109
        directions[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'
        All values in positions are distinct
